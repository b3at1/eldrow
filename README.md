A poorly made "sort of" wordle.


**Game Rules**

You don't win unless I say you do.<br />
"Trust me, it's not malware"<br />
You don't have to guess words, which defeats the purpose of the game.<br />
You lose if I say you do.<br />
Also, have fun I guess.<br />
RnG is everything.<br />
Oh, and you only win I tell you you did.<br />
"NOOo don't look at the source code it'll RUIN the GAME"<br />
Who knew people actually read the rules...<br />
