A poorly made "sort of" wordle.


**Game Rules**

You don't win unless I say you do.

"Trust me, it's not malware"

You don't have to guess words, which defeats the purpose of the game.

You lose if I say you do.

Also, have fun I guess.

RnG is everything.

Oh, and you only win I tell you you did.

"NOOo don't look at the source code it'll RUIN the GAME"

Who knew people actually read the rules...
