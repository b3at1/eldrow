A poorly made "sort of" wordle.


**Game Rules:**

You don't win unless I say you do.<br />
"Trust me, it's not malware"<br />
You don't have to guess words, which defeats the purpose of the game.<br />
You lose if I say you do.<br />
Also, have fun I guess.<br />
RnG is everything.<br />
Oh, and you only win I tell you you did.<br />
"NOOo don't look at the source code it'll RUIN the GAME"<br />
Who knew people actually read the rules...<br />

**Running It:**

You can run the source code, or run the binary if you are feeling risky. If you are feeling EXTRA risky, you can run the exe.
Feel free to fork and change things up (RnG, word bank, prizes, etc.)
<br /><br /><br />
That's all.
